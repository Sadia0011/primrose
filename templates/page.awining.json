            "content": "<p>All fabrics are made from 300gsm polyester. It's hard-wearing, waterproof, rot-proof, UV stabilised and easy to sponge clean. We also offer Acrylic fabric (Green stripe). The advantage of acrylic is that the individual threads are constructed from coloured material, whereas the polyester threads are made colourless and then dyed. If you cut an acrylic thread, you'll see the colour all the way through, whereas if you cut a polyester thread, you'll see a colourless centre. As a result, the colours of the acrylic can be more subtle; in addition, acrylic is slightly more fade-resistant.</p>",

If the awning is not taut enough or installed at an insufficient angle, rain water will accumulate on the waterproof awning fabric like a bag causing the fabric to stretch or tear. We recommend at least a 30 degree angle of incline for each awning providing the awning is sufficiently taut.</p><p>During heavy or wind-driven rain storms, make sure your awning is retracted to keep small puddles of rain from forming on top of the fabric, preventing future damage from stretching or staining.</p>",

            "title": "How much space is required for an awning? How high should I fit it?",
            "content": "<p>The recommended height from the ground is 2.5m/3.5m. If you want to install lower than this, determine whether there is sufficient headroom when the awning is fully extended and that any doors or windows can open.</p><p>The vertical size of the fixing bracket is about 7 inches (approx. 20cm). If space is tight you may wish to check that you have 7 clear inches before ordering. Our standard awnings can also be fitted to eaves or a horizontal surface using a ceiling/balcony bracket.</p><p>The width and projection of our awnings vary, so you'll need to check the specifics of the awning you are interested in to work out how much width and projected space is required.</p><p><strong>Installation</strong></p><p>As a guideline the minimum space required for installing an awning is approx. 50cm. This is to account for the size of the awning/cassette itself, but to also ensure that when projected, the drop does not result in an impractical rest height of the front bar e.g. If a 4m x 3m full cassette has a drop when fully projected of 80cm, then to achieve a sensible front bar rest height of 1.8m you would want the awning mounted 60cm above the window or door frame. It is also important that there is at least 5 courses of brick above where the awning is mounted, to ensure the fixture can suitably take the weight of the awning without the risk of damage to the wall. Please Note: It's the customers responsibility to ensure the site is suitable for an awning & should check with a builder/fitter before purchasing if in any doubt.</p><p><strong>Types of wall</strong></p><ul><li>Brickwork - This should be fine however if they have old bricks or reconstituted brickwork which is not as solid as standard masonry bricks they may need to use the RKEM resin kit. You also cannot fix into mortar.</li><li>Walling Blocks (e.g Breeze blocks) - This will vary depending on what type of breeze blocks they have, if it is a low or medium density block then no, they will not be able to install. However if they have high density breeze blocks then yes, it should be fine as long as they are using the RKEM resin kit.</li><li>Dry Walling (e.g plasterboard) - No, as the structure is too weak for the awning weights</li><li>Hardwood - Yes, however they will need to use coach bolts rather than the expansion bolts supplied. These can be found in most hardware stores across the UK. Structural timber would also be preferable.</li><li>Softwood - No, the structure of this wood is too weak for the weight of the awnings.</li><li>Wall Render - Yes, as long as there is minimal render, between 1-10mm, and that there is either solid brickwork or hardwood behind the render which the expansion bolts/coach bolts can grip into. Note: Cut back the render where the brackets are to be installed. The reason for this is that render can be bumpy and if not smoothed down then the awning may not be installed level.</li><li>Pebble dash - No, the application of pebble dash means that the awning is very unlikely to ever be completely level.</li><li>Metalwork - Yes, it is possible however we do not advise installation into metal work as it would either need to be welded on or attached using industrial components.</li><li>Tiles - No, installation is not recommended into any type of tiling. If you are still unsure please send an email, with an image to our approved fitters: sales@saffronsa.uk or to go to www.saffronshuttersandawnings.co.uk to obtain their contact information.</li></ul>",
