            "title": "Why choose a Kookaburra sail shade?",
            "content": "<p>Sail shades have long been popular in the southern hemisphere for their sun protection benefits. However, most sails are typically made with a loose weave fabric which allows heat to escape from under the garden sail and maintains a cool temperature when sat in the shade. This is important in hot climates where a place to cool off is a necessary requirement. But in the UK we tend to have more temperamental weather - a little colder and a lot wetter - which inspired Kookaburra to create a different type of sail shade.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.primrose.co.uk/products/_/sail-shades/breathable-sail-shades/plcid.4/plcid.84/\" title=\"Kookaburra\">Kookaburra</a>Â waterproof sail shades are made with a tighter weave which causes rainwater to simply run off the fabric. In Australia this would make it libilishly hot when sat under the sail with the sun beating down from above. Be sure to angle your sails for drainage to allow water to run off. But since we rarely get the same kind of temperatures the Australians are used to, there is little issue with keeping all that heat in; we like to think of it as an added bonus. And when you pair that with the knowledge the fabric will keep you nice and dry if an unexpected downpour breaks out, you've got the best of both worlds.</p><p>Alternatively, if you'd rather go with the more traditional style, Kookaburra offers aÂ <a href=\"https://www.primrose.co.uk/products/_/sail-shades/breathable-sail-shades/plcid.4/plcid.84/\" title=\"breathable range\">breathable range</a>Â available in standard and premium. These two styles both make use of a knitting process which leaves tiny holes in the fabric of the sail shade. Neither style is waterproof but both allow heat to escape from beneath the sail keeping your shaded area cool at all times.</p><p>Kookaburra sail shades are available in many colours and different shapes and sizes. Over 500 sail shades to choose from. They're rot proof and easy to clean. Most sails come with sturdy grade 304 stainless steel rings in each corner for lasting quality and durability. They are easy to hang and install, one way to transform your patio space in an instant. On top of that, most Kookaburra sails are covered by a minimum 2 year warranty as standard.</p>",

Triangle sail shades provide less shade than a square, but their main advantage is that they can be more flexible. Square and rectangle sail shades provide greater coverage and mimic the performance of an awning.</p><p>The key point to remember with a square or rectangle sail shade is that they are not perfectly square.
