This doesn't apply to a partial return or part cancellation of a multi-item order or bespoke or made-to-order items - see below.</p><p>As with returning items to a shop, it is your responsibility to arrange and pay for the return of goods that have been correctly supplied and are not faulty. It is important that any items you return are in perfect condition, undamaged and in their original packaging. We recommend that they are sent via an insured and signed-for service.</p><p>'Made to order' or 'bespoke' items will usually be described as such on the website. In addition, anything where you specify, for example a colour or size that is not described on the website is considered \"made to order\". Unfortunately, \"made to order\" or \"bespoke\" items cannot be cancelled or returned.</p><p>Your refund will be processed within 14 days of the date on which we receive the items back into our warehouses. Refunds will be made to the same payment method used to place the original order.</p><p>If you think you might want to return any goods, please don't use them outside or test them in a way that you wouldn't be able to in a shop, otherwise the goods may be devalued as a result, we retain the right to deduct an amount considered equal to the diminished value of the handled goods from your final refund amount. If the product is sealed in see-through plastic that allows you to examine the contents as you would in a shop, please don't open the packaging. Otherwise, don't hesitate to inspect the goods, but please don't damage or dispose of the packaging until you're sure you want to keep it.</p>",
